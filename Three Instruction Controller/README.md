This is the Controller that can execute 3 instructions - INC, CLR, and JMP (Increment, Clear, and Jump commands).
The opcodes for the 3 commands are:
* INC opcode -> 0110 = 6
* CLR opcode -> 0111 = 7
* JMP opcode -> 1000 = 8

We have the verilog code for the Three Instruction Controller, which we convert to bsf (symbol file).  

The symbol file for our ThreeController is
